# Concept

The branding concept has been developed in a paper by Taylor et al. with the aim, among others, of promoting greater clarity and scalability in the naming of variables used in WCRP model intercompaison projects (MIPs).

Taylor et al. propose an approach in which the brand is defined in terms of four short labels:

* TemporalLabelDD
* VerticalLabelDD
* HorizontalLabelDD
* AreaLabelDD
